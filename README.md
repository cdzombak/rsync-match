# rsync-match

My canonical music library lives in iTunes on my OS X laptop.

iTunes Match [doesn't work](https://twitter.com/cdzombak/status/800818044201156613), so instead I've set up [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) on a Mac Mini in my home. I use that to stream/sync my music files to all other devices.

~~This script runs on the laptop once per hour (with `cdz.curie-match.plist`) and syncs my music library to the Mac Mini running Plex (named `curie-srv`).~~

I run this script as needed to sync my music library to the Mac Mini running Plex (named `curie-srv`).
